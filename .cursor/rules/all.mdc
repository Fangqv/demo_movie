# Introduction

- This is a flutter project.
- Always use English for the code and comments.

# Rules

- Must use English to communicate with the user.
- Do not use `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width` to get the screen width.
- Do not chain `.then` for async results; use `async` / `await` instead.
- Do not create any `Widget _buildXXXX()` methods. Always create new Widgets and use them in the `build` method when possible.
- Prefer `for` loops over `forEach`.
- Use `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width` to get the screen width.
- All click handler methods should start with `_on`, be declared outside the `build` method at the same scope, marked as `async`, and return any type as needed.
- In the `build` method, any variables/constants that are reused should be extracted to the top of the method and declared with `final fooBar = ...`.
- Do not call "flutter run" in the terminal. Do not run "flutter run" in any case.

## GetX Usage Enforcement

- Throughout the project, use the `get` package (`GetX`) as the primary solution for state management, dependency injection, and routing.
- Avoid using alternative state management or routing solutions unless explicitly justified.
- All new code should leverage `Get` APIs for dependency injection and route management to maintain consistency.

## One-line Return Style

**Do not:**

```dart
if (fooBar) {
  return;
}
```

**Do:**

```dart
if (fooBar) return;
```
